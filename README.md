# Monet GAN Generator

Generate Monet-style paintings using deep learning.

## Overview

This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create new paintings in Claude Monet's impressionist style. The goal is to generate 7,000-10,000 high-quality images that capture Monet's distinctive brushstrokes and color palettes.

## Dataset

- 300 authentic Monet paintings (256×256 pixels)
- 7,028 photograph images (256×256 pixels)
- Available in JPEG and TFRecords format

## Approach

- **Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Model**: GAN architecture
- **Method**: Generate new paintings from noise (not style transfer)

The model learns Monet's artistic patterns and creates entirely new paintings rather than converting existing photos.
